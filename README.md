# White Wine Exploration

## Exploratory Data Analysis project 

This project is part of Udacity's Data Analysit Nanodegree Program. In this project, I used R and applied exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies. <br>

The files contained are:
- and rmd file containing my exploration efforts
- and html file which was knitted from the rmd, to present my efforts in a clean and aestethically pleasing way
- the original data set which contains 4,898 white wines with 11 variables on quantifying the chemical properties of each wine, together with their rating.
